# Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Linear Programming

## Problem Generation

- To generate a single feasible and bounded problem for testing, run:
```
generate_feasible_problem.m 
```

## Solver Functions

```
admm_for_primal.m 
```

```
admm_for_dual.m
```

```
admm_primal_barrier.m
```

```
admm_dual_barrier.m
```
